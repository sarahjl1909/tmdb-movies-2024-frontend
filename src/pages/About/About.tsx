          This project was developed as part of a technical challenge. The main
          goal was to build a web application that would display a catalog of
          movies, allowing users to browse, search, and view detailed
          information about each movie. The application was developed using
          React for the frontend and with The Movie Database (TMDB) dataset to
          retrieve movie data using the Flask API.
